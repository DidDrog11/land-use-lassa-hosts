# Abstract  

1.  The natal multimammate mouse (*Mastomys natalensis*) is the primary reservoir host of *Mammarenavirus lassaense* (LASV), a zoonotic pathogen causing Lassa fever and endemic to West Africa. The occurrence and abundance of this species is regulated by the human environment and biotic interactions with other small-mammal species, but these ecological drivers remain poorly understood in the regions where Lassa fever outbreaks are observed. 
2.  We developed a Bayesian multi-species occupancy model incorporating incomplete detection to assess habitat use from data obtained as part of a multi-year small-mammal trapping study (43,226 trap nights across four village sites in Sierra Leone, 2020-2023). We investigated the effects of land use gradients and small-mammal community dynamics on the spatial distribution of *M. natalensis*.
3.  *Mastomys natalensis* occupancy increased along a gradient from forest to agriculture to village habitats but was reduced in the peri-urban site compared to rural settings. Invasive rodent species influenced this pattern, with *Mus musculus* presence associated with reduced *M. natalensis* occupancy in the peri-urban site. We did not observe a similar effect when considering the co-occurrence of invasive *Rattus rattus* with *M. natalensis* in rural settings.  
4.  These findings suggest that land use and species interactions drive spatial heterogeneity in *M. natalensis* populations, potentially explaining reduced Lassa fever incidence in urban areas. The results highlight the importance of considering community dynamics when predicting the risk of outbreaks of endemic zoonoses and the need to widen the context of studies of LASV transmission beyond the primary reservoir host species. 
5.  To better assess public health risk and improve allocation of limited resources, we recommend more precise characterisation of small-mammal communities in LASV endemic regions, particularly in areas undergoing rapid land use change which may alter community-level small-mammal biodiversity.

# Introduction

Global biodiversity is in decline, with biodiversity loss directly influencing zoonotic disease risk [@sala_global_2000; @mantyka-pringle_climate_2015; @ipbes_workshop_2020; @hallidayBiodiversityLossUnderlies2020]. Land use change, particularly the conversion of natural habitats into agricultural or urban landscapes, is a key driver of biodiversity loss, reducing mammalian species diversity across several dimensions [@newbold_global_2015]. These include taxonomic diversity (the number and relative abundance of taxa), functional diversity (the range of roles organisms play within an ecosystem), and interaction diversity (the biotic interactions among species) [@naeem_functions_2012; @glidden_human-mediated_2021]. These declines in biodiversity, particularly in rodent-associated disease systems, may exacerbate zoonotic disease risks by promoting the proliferation of generalist, synanthropic rodents that thrive in human-modified landscapes, where they host zoonotic pathogens [@young_declines_2014; @gibb_zoonotic_2020; @ecke_population_2022]. This shift may therefore not only increase the prevalence of zoonotic pathogens but also human exposure in complex socio-ecological systems [@gibb_towards_2025].

The role of host community diversity in mediating zoonotic outbreaks is nuanced, with changes in species composition and pathogen prevalence often interacting with anthropogenic stressors to create context-specific outcomes [@gibb_zoonotic_2020; @keesing_impacts_2021; @carlson_pathogens_2025]. A deeper mechanistic understanding of these processes, including community structure, biotic interactions, and responses to anthropogenic land use change, is critical for leveraging biodiversity knowledge to predict and mitigate zoonotic risks [@salkeld_meta-analysis_2013; @glidden_human-mediated_2021; @carlson_pathogens_2025]. These approaches have only been taken for a few rodent-associated zoonoses [@keesing_emerging_2024].

Rodents are an important mammalian host taxa for zoonotic diseases [@han_rodent_2015; @mendoza_does_2019]. Rodent-associated zoonoses, such as Lyme disease caused by *Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato*, have been shown to involve a complex interplay of community structure, biotic interactions, and the effect of land use change [@ostfeld_are_2004]. For instance, land use change can increase reservoir abundance and subsequently zoonotic risk, though responses vary across systems and settings, highlighting the idosyncratic or system specific nature of these dynamics [@young_interacting_2017; @mendoza_does_2019; @pei_anthropogenic_2024]. 

Lassa fever, caused by *Mammarenavirus lassaense* (LASV), is an important rodent-associated zoonosis endemic to West Africa. It is reported from Nigeria, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Mali, Benin, Ghana and Togo and causes an estimated 900,000 annual infections with substantial morbidity and mortality [@world_health_organisation_lassa_2022; @basinski_bridging_2021]. Risk of infection in human populations is spatially heterogeneous with patchy distributions of reported cases across the endemic region [@gibb_understanding_2017; @agbonlahor_52_2021; @grant_seroprevalence_2023]. While epidemiological factors such as acquired immunity and asymptomatic infections may contribute, reservoir host ecology and distribution are likely critical drivers of this variation, though heterogeneous reporting effort may also be a contributing factor [@mccormick_prospective_1987; @redding_geographical_2021; @simons_lassa_2022]. 

*Mastomys natalensis*, considered the main reservoir host of LASV, is a synanthropic rodent species found throughout sub-Saharan Africa [@olayemiArenavirusDiversityPhylogeography2016; @iucn_iucn_2016]. It is abundant in and around areas of human-dominated landscapes where it is considered a pest species [@leirs_productivity_1993]. Population dynamics in *M. natalensis* are influenced by resource availability and seasonal rainfall pulses, which drive fluctuations in abundance that coincide with increased human Lassa fever outbreaks [@leirs_forecasting_1996; @leirs_stochastic_1997; @redding_geographical_2021]. However, most intensive ecological studies of *M. natalensis* have been conducted outside the Lassa fever endemic region, in regions with differing agro-ecologies, potentially limiting their applicability to West Africa [@leirs_forecasting_1996]. The effects of land use change on rodent communities in the endemic region have only been explored across a limited geographic area, with most studies focusing solely on *M. natalensis* [@fichet-calvet_spatial_2005; @fichet-calvet_diversity_2009; @fichet-calvet_lassa_2014; @olayemi_small_2018; @arruda_niche_2021]. The limited number of studies that do consider the wider rodent community typically focus on abundance (measured through summary proxies such as trap-success) rather than explicitly investigating community dynamics [@fichet-calvet_diversity_2009; @eskew_reservoir_2024].

There is a pressing need for systematic small-mammal community studies in West Africa to ensure that insights from other rodent-associated zoonoses can be generalised to Lassa fever. Such studies can help disentangle the respective roles of abiotic factors, such as land use type, and biotic interactions within small-mammal communities in shaping *M. natalensis* distributions and pathogen exposure risks. *Mastomys natalensis* occurs within species-rich settings in West Africa; however, the biotic interactions between this species and other native and invasive rodents within these communities, and how these interactions may regulate *M. natalensis* occurrence are not well described [@fichet-calvet_diversity_2009; @garba_spatial_2014; @cuypers_no_2017; @hima_native_2019]. Past studies have indicated that competitive interactions with *Rattus rattus* and *Mus musculus* can alter native rodent communities, and might therefore reshape *M. natalensis* local distributions with subsequent effects on LASV transmission and Lassa fever hazard [@dalecky_range_2015; @lippens_genetic_2017; @eskew_reservoir_2024]. Sierra Leone is associated with frequent outbreaks of Lassa fever in human populations, with evidence of outbreaks beyond the traditionally accepted endemic region, but with limited evidence for how community dynamics might influence these patterns. [@monath_lassa_1974; @keenlyside_case-control_1983; @mccormick_prospective_1987; @bonner_poor_2007; @bonwitt_at_2017; @bangura_lassa_2021; @grant_seroprevalence_2023; @eskew_reservoir_2024].

Given these gaps in understanding, we sought to explore how small-mammal communities are structured across land use gradients in Eastern Sierra Leone and how these dynamics influence the distribution of *M. natalensis*. To achieve this we conducted repeated, systematic, rodent trapping along a land use gradient in Eastern Sierra Leone to investigate how land use influences small-mammal communities and the distribution of *M. natalensis*. We hypothesised that: (1) small-mammal community diversity varies with land use, with lower diversity in more anthropogenic habitats; (2) *M. natalensis* occupancy is positively associated with anthropogenic land use but negatively influenced by competition with other sympatric species; and (3) species interactions within small-mammal communities regulate the local distribution of *M. natalensis*, thereby shaping LASV outbreak risk. Sierra Leone, a hotspot for Lassa fever, provides a unique opportunity to explore these dynamics in a region where rodent ecology studies have largely focused on *M. natalensis*, often neglecting the broader small-mammal community. We expect these analyses to further understanding of small-mammal community structures that may explain observed patterns of LASV outbreaks within this context and the wider endemic region.

# Methods

## Small-mammal sampling

We conducted small-mammal trapping surveys from October 2020 to April 2023 at four village study sites (Baiama, Lalehun, Lambayama, and Seilama) located in the Lassa fever endemic zone of Sierra Leone's Eastern Province (Figure 1A). Site selection was informed by discussions with the Kenema Government Hospital Lassa Fever team and guided by remote imaging data to ensure representation of prior disease outbreak areas. Trapping grids were established along a gradient of anthropogenic disturbance, encompassing forest, agricultural land (both fallow and active), and village areas (inside and outside permanent structures). Each village study site was assigned one forest grid, three to four agricultural grids, and two village grids, except for Lambayama, which lacked forested land (Supplementary Figure 1 A-D). Trapping survey sessions within each village occurred four times annually with two trapping surveys in each of the rainy and dry seasons (May to November and December to April, respectively). This produced a total of 10 trapping session at Lalehun and Seilama, and 8 trapping sessions at Baiama and Lambayama over the study period due to logistical constraints (Figure 1B).

To explore the influence of human population density on small-mammal communities, we classified village study sites as either rural or peri-urban. This classification was based on population density data from WorldPop for 2020 at a 100m resolution [@WorldPop2025]. We adopted the classifications proposed by Dijkstra *et al* for country specific density thresholds defining urban centres as those with a density in excess of 1,000 individuals/km^2^ and a contiguous population of at least 50,000 [@dijkstraApplyingDegreeUrbanisation2021]. Under this definition, Lambayama (5,227 individuals/km^2^) was classified as peri-urban (an urban cluster in their manuscript), while Baiama (131 individuals/km^2^), Lalehun (159 individuals/km^2^), and Seilama (48 individuals/km^2^) were classified as rural.

We selected village study sites and trapping grids to be representative of land use in the Eastern Province of Sierra Leone, based on accessibility and acceptability of the study protocol to communities (Supplementary Information 1). Trapping grids consisted of 49 Sherman traps (7.62 × 8.89 × 22.86 cm; H.B. Sherman Traps, Tallahassee, USA), arranged in a 7 × 7 layout with 7-metre spacing between traps, adjusted to the local terrain (median grid area = 3,882 m^2^). For grids within permanent structures, the grid arrangement was modified: individual buildings were semi-randomly selected using a projected village grid, and four traps were deployed per structure. The location of each individual trap was geolocated. Traps were baited with a locally produced mixture of oats, palm oil and dried fish. Each morning, traps were checked and closed for the day prior to re-baiting during the evening. Each trapping survey session consisted of four consecutive trap-nights (TN) at each trapping grid.

For downstream analysis, we used geospatial software to assign individual trap locations to a standardized grid cell system based on their physical coordinates (Supplementary Figure 2). First, a convex hull encompassing all trapping sessions for a grid was generated. A regular grid composed of  49 m^2^ cells was overlaid on this polygon, and traps were assigned to cells. This process resulted in 2,068 unique grid cells across all sites. Grid cells were included in the analysis even if they were only sampled during a single trapping session, as the occupancy model framework can accommodate sites with varying numbers of survey replicates. The four consecutive trap-nights from each trap within a grid cell during a single survey were pooled as a single replicate for the statistical analysis. Geospatial processing was performed using the `sf` package R (version 4.1.2) [@pebesma_simple_2018; @r_core_team_r_2021]. 

All small mammals were handled by trained researchers wearing appropriate personal protective equipment. Animals were sedated using halothane and euthanized according to established protocols [@fichet-calvet_chapter_2014]. Morphological measurements and samples of blood and tissue were collected. The study was approved by the Clinical Research Ethical Review Board and Animal Welfare Ethical Review Board of the Royal Veterinary College, UK (URN: 2019 1949-3), and the ethical review board of Njala University, Sierra Leone, and adhered to national and institutional ethical guidelines. Sex was determined based on external and internal genitalia. Age classification was informed by reproductive status and lens weight from dried eye samples. Photographs of the dorsal and ventral aspects of each rodent were taken for morphological documentation. All carcasses were incinerated to mitigate pathogen transmission risks.

## Species classification

Species identification was performed in the field based on external morphological characteristics, including body length, tail length, ear length, and pelage colouration, following the taxonomic keys of Kingdon and Happold [@kingdon_mammals_2013] and Monadjem *et al.* [@monadjem_rodents_2015] (Supplementary Information 2). Field identification was supplemented by molecular methods to confirm species identity for individuals identified as *Mastomys sp.*, *Mus sp.*, *Rattus sp.* and *Crocidura sp.* alongside a random subset of remaining individuals (50% of remaining samples). 

Samples were stored at -20°C until processing, genomic DNA was extracted using QIAGEN DNeasy kits as per the manufacturer's instructions [@qiagen_dneasy_2023] (Supplementary Information 1). DNA extracts were amplified via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using *cytochrome B* primers, and amplification success was confirmed via gel electrophoresis [@bangura_lassa_2021]. Full details of the PCR and sequencing protocols are provided in Supplementary Information 1. Successful PCR products were purified and submitted for Sanger sequencing (performed by Eurofins Genomics). Attribution of sequences to rodent species was performed using the BLAST programme, comparing obtained sequences to *cytochrome B* records in the NCBI database (accessed 2023-06-30) [@altschul_basic_1990].

## Description of small-mammal detection and species community structure

Adequacy of sampling effort was assessed using species accumulation curves produced for each village study site and each land use type within a village study site, generated with the `specaccum` function from the `vegan` package [@vegan_2022]. The rarefaction method was applied to evaluate whether sampling was sufficient to detect the expected rodent species within these categories. Curves were visually inspected, and most demonstrated a plateau, suggesting adequate sampling effort (Supplementary Figure 3).

Detection/non-detection histories for each grid cell and small-mammal species were constructed, assigning "1" when a species was detected and "0" otherwise. Species communities were described at multiple spatial scales: (i) all species identified across all village sites and land use types, (ii) all species identified within a village study site, and (iii) all species identified within a single land use type within a single village study site. Species richness and Shannon diversity were calculated at each of these spatial scales [@shannon_mathematical_1948].

## Estimating the effect of land use on species occurrence and richness

To adjust for differential probabilities of detection, we used a Bayesian spatial latent factor multi-species occupancy model that incorporates residual species correlations, imperfect detection, and spatial autocorrelation. The model assumes that the true occupancy state of a species at a site (${z}_{i,j}$) is constant throughout the study period. Variable selection was informed by a pre-specified conceptual model (Supplementary Figure 4). Models were defined using the `sfMsPGOcc` function in the `spOccupancy` package in the R statistical computing language [@doser_spoccupancy_2022]. This approach defines the true presence or absence ($_{z}$) of a species ($_{i}$), at grid cell ($_{j}$) as arising from a Bernoulli process (Equation 1). Where ${\psi}_{j}$ is the probability of occurrence of a species at a grid cell. This is modelled using a logit link where $\beta_{i}$ are the species-specific regression coefficients of the site-specific covariates (${\boldsymbol{x}}_{j}^{\top}$) and a latent process $\text{w}^*_{i, j}$ that incorporates residual species correlations and spatial autocorrelation (Equation 2).

$$
{z}_{i,j}\sim \mathrm{Bernoulli}\left({\psi}_{i,j}\right) \tag{1}
$$

$$
\mathrm{logit}\left({\psi}_{i,j}\right)={\boldsymbol{x}}_{j}^{\top}\boldsymbol{\beta_{i}} + \text{w}^*_{i, j} \tag{2}
$$

The species-specific regression coefficients ($\beta_{i}$) are specified as random effects arising from a common community-level distribution (Equation 3), where $\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\beta}$ is the community-level mean effect and  $\boldsymbol{T}_{\beta}$ is a diagonal matrix representing the inter-species variability.

$$
\boldsymbol{\beta}_i \sim \text{Normal}(\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\beta}, \boldsymbol{T}_{\beta}) \tag{3}
$$

The detection component estimates the unobserved ${z}_{i,j}$. Here, ${y}_{i,j,k}$ is the observed detection or non-detection of a species $_i$, at site $_j$, during replicate $_k$ (Equation 4). This is approached as a Bernoulli process conditional on the true latent occurrence state ${z}_{i,j}$ and the detection probability ${p}_{i,j,k}$. The probability of a species being detected at a grid cell during a replicate (given it is present), is a function of grid cell and replicate specific covariates ${\boldsymbol{v}}$ and a set of species-specific regression coefficients ${\boldsymbol{\alpha}}_{i}$ (Equation 5).

$$
{y}_{i,j,k}\sim \mathrm{Bernoulli}\left({p}_{i,j,k}{z}_{i,j}\right) \tag{4}
$$


$$
\mathrm{logit}\left({p}_{i,j,k}\right)={\boldsymbol{v}}_{i,j,k}^{\top}\boldsymbol{\alpha}_{i} \tag{5}
$$


Similarly to the occurrence component, these detection coefficients are specified as random effects arising from a common community-level distribution (Equation 6).

$$
\boldsymbol{\alpha}_i \sim \text{Normal}(\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\alpha}, \boldsymbol{T}_{\alpha}) \tag{6}
$$

Minimally informative priors were specified for community-level mean parameters ($\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\alpha}$ and $\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\beta}$, Normal(0, 2.72)) and variance parameters ($\boldsymbol{T}_{\alpha}$ and $\boldsymbol{T}_{\beta}$, Inverse-Gamma(0.1,0.1)).

We developed a set of candidate models based on our conceptual model (Supplementary Figure 4) after assessing covariates for collinearity (correlation >0.8). Continuous variables were standardised. The full candidate model for occurrence included land use type, village, distance to permanent structure, and elevation (Equation 7), while the full detection model included monthly precipitation, moon fraction, and trapping effort (Equation 8).

$$
\text{Probability of occurrence} \sim \text{Land use type} + \text{Village} + \text{scale}(\text{Distance to permanent structure}) + \text{scale}(\text{Elevation}) \tag{7}
$$

$$
\text{Probability of detection} \sim \text{scale}(\text{Monthly precipitation}) + \text{Moon fraction} + \text{scale}(\text{Number of trap nights}) \tag{8}
$$

We performed model selection using the Widely Applicable Information Criterion (WAIC) [@watanabe_asymptotic_2010]. Posterior predictive checks were used to assess goodness-of-fit for the top model. The most parsimonious model, which we used for all subsequent inference, included land use type and study village in the occurrence component (Equation 9) and the full set of covariates in the detection component (Equation 8), along with a single latent spatial factor. Only species with at least 25 detections were included in this analysis. While a model with an interaction between land use and the rural/peri-urban classification was considered (Supplementary Table 1), the main effects model provided a better fit. For visualization (Figure 3), we present the predictions from this final model stratified by the rural/peri-urban classification to explore how these main effects manifest across this demographic gradient.

$$
\text{Probability of occurrence} \sim \text{Land use type} + \text{Village} \tag{9}
$$

## Co-occurrence of *Mastomys natalensis* with sympatric species

To investigate the potential for biotic interactions to shape species distributions, we examined correlations in the predicted probabilities of occupancy between species pairs. This approach, which analyzes the residual associations after accounting for environmental drivers in a joint species distribution model, is designed to distinguish potential biotic interactions from patterns caused by shared habitat filtering [@damenDisentanglingBioticInteractions2018]. These probabilities were derived for each grid cell from the final spatial multi-species occupancy model. Analyses were stratified by land use type, and the Spearman rank correlation coefficient ($\rho$) was calculated for each species pair. A two-sided test for statistical significance was performed, with the null hypothesis being no correlation.

To minimise inference from sparse data, this analysis was restricted to species pairs that were co-detected within the specific land use type being examined. Additionally, given the multiple statistical tests performed, we adopted a conservative threshold for statistical significance (*p* ≤ 0.0005). This more stringent threshold is necessary to account for the large number of pairwise comparisons and the large sample size (N = 2,068 grid cells), which increases the risk of detecting spurious correlations [@benjamin_redefine_2018]. In our interpretation, we focused on associations that were both statistically significant and demonstrated at least a moderate effect size (|$\rho$| > 0.4), to distinguish ecologically meaningful patterns from weak correlations that may appear significant due to the large sample size. Statistically significant correlations were interpreted as indicating that one species was either more likely (positive correlation) or less likely (negative correlation) to occupy a grid cell within a given land use type when the other species was present. However, this analysis does not allow for inferences regarding the causal mechanism or directionality of any observed relationships (e.g., whether one species excludes or is excluded by another) [@blanchetCooccurrenceNotEvidence2020].

# Results

## Small-mammal detection and species community structure

Over the study period 684 individual small mammals were detected from 43,266 trap-nights across the four village study sites, yielding an overall trap success (TS) of 1.6%. Species accumulation curves suggest that sampling effort was generally adequate, although some curves, particularly for land use types within a single village, did not reach a clear plateau, indicating that additional rare species might be detected with further sampling (Supplementary Figure 3).

The agricultural areas had the highest species richness and Shannon diversity values, while trap success was greatest in village settings (Table 1). Among the study sites, Seilama had the highest overall trap success and species richness. Notably, Seilama also exhibited the greatest trap success within agricultural areas, unlike the other three sites. Species richness in Seilama was twice that of Lambayama, the peri-urban village study site, which had the lowest species richness and Shannon diversity. In Lambayama, most rodents were detected within built-up village areas, reflecting its proximity to Kenema city.

The most commonly detected rodent species across all land use types was *M. natalensis* (N = 113, 16.5%), followed by *Praomys rostratus* (N = 102, 14.9%), *M. musculus* (N = 90, 13.2%), *R. rattus* (N = 88, 12.9%), *Lophuromys sikapusi* (N = 57, 8.3%) and *Mus setulosus* (N = 43, 6.3%). Among non-rodent species, the insectivorous shrew *Crocidura olivieri* was the most frequently detected (N = 105, 15.4%). *Mastomys natalensis* and *R. rattus* were found in all village study sites, although *M. natalensis* was absent in forest settings (Figure 2). The invasive rodent *M. musculus* was detected only in Lambayama, the peri-urban site.

Trap success varied significantly by species, land use type, and village study site. The highest TS was observed for *M. musculus* in the Lambayama village site, while *M. natalensis* and *R. rattus* showed high TS across multiple sites in village land use types. In contrast, *P. rostratus* had the highest detection rates in forest and agricultural areas.

Seasonal variation in species detection was observed but did not show consistent trends across all species. While *M. musculus* had higher TS during the rainy season, species such as *L. sikapusi* and *Mus setulosus* were more frequently detected in the dry season. For most other species, TS was similar across seasons (Supplementary Figure 5A). When stratified by land use type, more distinct variations were evident. For instance, *M. natalensis* had higher TS in village settings than in agricultural areas during the rainy season, while TS in these two habitats were more similar during the dry season. *P. rostratus* showed substantially higher TS in forests during the dry season compared to the rainy season. Other species showed notable seasonal patterns: TS for *R. rattus* were higher in villages than in agriculture in both seasons, with this difference being more pronounced during the rainy season. Finally, *L. sikapusi* TS was highest in agricultural areas during the dry season but shifted to being higher in villages during the rainy season (Supplementary Figure 5B).

## Estimating the effect of land use on species occurrence and richness

We found three patterns of probability of occurrence ($\psi$) within a trapping grid cell for the seven included species (Figure 3 and, marginal effects of the detection parameters are shown in Supplementary Figures 6-8). First, *M. natalensis*, *R. rattus* and *M. musculus* had greatest probabilities of occurrence in villages with lower occurrence probabilities in agricultural and forest areas. *Mastomys natalensis* differed from the two commensal, invasive species (*R. rattus* and *M. musculus*) as their probability of occurrence in agricultural settings, while lower than village settings, remained generally high. Second, *P. rostratus* had high probability of occurrence in forests with lower probabilities in agricultural areas and villages. Finally, *C. olivieri*, *L. sikapusi* and *M. setulosus* had their highest probabilities of occurrence in agricultural areas with lower probabilities of occurrence in forests and villages. No species showed high probability of occurrence across all land use types, consistent with species being adapted to distinct ecological niches.

The probability of occurrence within a trapping grid cell of the same land use type showed wide variability for some species. For example, the narrow range of probabilities for *M. natalensis* in forests (0-13%) suggests this species is unlikely to occur there. In contrast, the wide variability for *P. rostratus* in agricultural areas (0-90%) suggests that additional environmental factors beyond land use type are affecting the probability of occurrence. As our final model included an effect of village, this indicates that village-level factors likely contribute to this variation, alongside finer-scale differences among individual grid cells within a given village.

To further explore this, we stratified the results by the rural and peri-urban classification (Figure 3). The probability of occurrence of *M. natalensis* was substantially lower in the peri-urban study site compared to the rural sites. The same pattern was observed for *R. rattus*. For the rodent species predicted to have lower probability of occurrence in village settings (*P. rostratus*, *L. sikapusi* and *M. setulosus*) probabilities of occurrence were greater in all land use types in rural areas compared to peri-urban areas. Shrew species had similar probabilities of occurrence in rural and peri-urban areas. 

In contrast to species found throughout our study area, *M. musculus* was predicted to have a low probability of occurrence in all land use types in rural areas, with high probabilities of occurrence only for village settings in the single peri-urban site. The occurrence probabilities for the three commensal species (*M. natalensis*, *R. rattus* and *M. musculus*) suggest that competition may be a factor in reducing the occurrence probabilities of *M. natalensis* and *R. rattus* in the presence of *M. musculus*, as in its absence these two species have high occurrence probabilities in villages.

## Co-occurrence of species within land use types

The tests for species correlations reveal patterns consistent with our original hypothesis that the local spatial distribution of *M. natalensis* is regulated by biotic interactions with co-occurring species (Figure 4). In the single peri-urban site where both *M. natalensis* and *M. musculus* co-occurred, the presence of one species was associated with a reduced probability of occurrence for the other, with statistically significant and ecologically meaningful negative correlations in agricultural ($\rho$ = -0.67, *p* < 0.0001) and village ($\rho$ = -0.35, *p* < 0.0001) land uses. In contrast, a positive correlation was found between the occurrences of *M. natalensis* and the other commensal, invasive rodent *R. rattus*, with significant positive correlations in both agricultural ($\rho$ = 0.51, *p* < 0.0001) and village ($\rho$ = 0.36, *p* < 0.0001) settings.

Beyond these focal species, other strong patterns of association were evident. Within villages, high probabilities of *M. musculus* presence were negatively correlated with the probability of occurrence for all other rodent species included in the analysis. In contrast, the native rodent species *P. rostratus*, *L. sikapusi*, and *M. setulosus* were all positively correlated with each other in agricultural and village habitats. The shrew species, *C. olivieri*, was generally negatively correlated with the presence of rodent species across all land use types, with the notable exception of a positive correlation with *M. musculus* in agricultural land use.

# Discussion

This study provides valuable insights into the dynamics of small-mammal communities in a Lassa fever endemic region of Eastern Sierra Leone, focusing on how land use types influence species richness, diversity, and the risk of viral spillover. Our results indicate that species richness and diversity were highest in agricultural settings. These habitats support both synanthropic and non-synanthropic species, increasing the potential for viral sharing. The highest probability of occupancy for the main LASV reservoir host, *M. natalensis*, was observed in villages and agricultural settings, while it was likely absent from forests. This pattern mirrors that of the invasive commensal species *M. musculus* and *R. rattus*, suggesting that human-modified landscapes are key drivers of rodent distribution. Stratification by human population density revealed that *M. natalensis* occupancy was lower in the peri-urban site, where *M. musculus* dominates. Importantly, we identified a negative correlation in the probability of co-occurrence between *M. natalensis* and *M. musculus*, which could have important implications for understanding observed Lassa fever outbreaks.

## Small-mammal communities are associated with land use type

Small-mammal species richness was greatest in agricultural settings where both synanthropic and non-synanthropic species were found. The higher species richness in agricultural environments provides more opportunities for cross-species transmission of LASV within diverse small-mammal communities.

Evidence suggests that the wider species community may play a role in LASV transmission. Early LASV isolations from *M. natalensis*, *R. rattus* and *M. minutoides* in Nigeria suggested a more complex ecology than initially assumed [@wulffRecentIsolationsLassa1975].  Since then, LASV infection has been detected in 5 further rodent species (*Mastomys erythroleucus*, *Mus baoulei*, *H. pamfi*, *L. sikapusi* and *P. rostratus*) while antibodies to LASV have been detected in 8 further rodent species and one shrew genus (*Arvicanthis niloticus*, *Gerbilliscus kempii*, *Lemniscomys striatus*, *Malacomys edwardsi*, *M. musculus*, *Mus setulosus*, *Praomys daltoni*, *Praomys misonnei* and *Crocidura sp.*) (Supplementary Table 2) [@monath_lassa_1974; @demby_lassa_2001; @fichet-calvet_lassa_2014; @olayemi_new_2016; @simons_rodent_2023]. However, particularly for species where only serological evidence exists, these findings must be interpreted with caution. The detection of antibodies confirms exposure to an arenavirus but may not be specific to LASV; given the increasing discovery of novel arenaviruses in West African small mammals, some seropositivity could reflect exposure to other, related viruses rather than LASV itself [@olayemiSystematicsEcologyHost2020a]. Whether these infections are incidental or represent competent chains of viral transmission remains unclear. It is possible that viral sharing within small-mammal communities is greatest in the more species-rich agricultural settings, allowing introduction or re-introduction of LASV into isolated commensal species populations following local viral extinction [@bordes_transmission_2015]. This may be particularly important for maintaining viral persistence through time in spatially isolated *M. natalensis* populations, where rapid depletion of susceptible individuals might be expected [@goyens_density_2013]. Our findings, along with previous studies, show that *M. natalensis* is absent from forested regions may indicate that its populations are spatially isolated, particularly in the mosaic landscapes of remnant forest and agriculture that characterize much of Sierra Leone and West Africa [@leirs_spatial_1996; @huber_community_2005; @marien_movement_2018]. The role of the wider rodent community in facilitating LASV transmission between these isolated populations warrants further investigation, particularly for species found in forested settings such as *P. rostratus* and *M. setulosus* [@fichet-calvet_lassa_2014; @olayemi_new_2016].

Although previous studies from Guinea and Sierra Leone have reported seasonal fluctuations in *M. natalensis* abundance, our findings of similar or increased abundance during the dry season suggest that localized factors, such as agricultural practices or food storage, may influence rodent behaviour in this region differently than previously documented [@fichet-calvet_fluctuation_2007; @bangura_lassa_2021]. Alternatively, increased trap-shyness during periods of increased abundance may mask replication of previous findings. Further studies on small-mammal communities, incorporating local human community behaviour and practices, conducted over longer time periods and across different geographic regions, would be valuable in identifying how seasonal habitat preferences of these rodents vary [@kelly_housing_2013; @leach_local_2017]. These findings underscore the importance of considering local human activities, such as food storage and agricultural practices, when modelling seasonal patterns in rodent behaviour. Such practices may alter rodent abundance and movement in ways that differ from areas where *M. natalensis* displays more predictable seasonal patterns due to other environmental or ecological factors.

The abundance of *M. natalensis* within households has been suggested as a key driver of Lassa fever outbreaks, likely due to increased human-rodent contact [@bonwitt_at_2017; @marien_households_2020]. Therefore, the movement of *M. natalensis* from species-rich agricultural areas to households may play a critical role in the transmission dynamics of LASV.

## Evidence for biotic interactions shaping patterns of small-mammal species diversity

The segregation of small-mammal species into distinct ecological niches, categorised by human-dominated or non-human-dominated land use types, underscores the significant role of abiotic factors in shaping species distributions. However, within these habitats, the residual spatial associations suggest that biotic interactions also play a key role. While recognizing the inherent challenges of inferring ecological processes from spatial patterns, our analysis of residual correlations after accounting for habitat effects reveals several important associations [@blanchetCooccurrenceNotEvidence2020].

Our findings show a high predicted occupancy of both *M. natalensis* and *R. rattus* in human-dominated landscapes, with a positive correlation in their co-occurrence, aligning with a similar study in Sierra Leone [@bangura_lassa_2021]. In contrast, the negative correlation between M. musculus and the larger *M. natalensis* and *R. rattus* in the peri-urban site presents an apparent competitive paradox. Direct physical competition seems unlikely given the significant size difference. However, evidence from Senegal suggests that *M. musculus* can indeed displace both native rodents and *R. rattus* during its expansion [@dalecky_range_2015]. The mechanism is likely not direct aggression but rather a combination of competition, niche specialization and effects of predation [@polisIntraguildPredationDynamics1992]. *Mus musculus* is exceptionally adapted to the indoor environment and may be a more efficient forager on the scattered, high-quality resources found within human dwellings in West Africa [@vrbanecEnhancedProblemsolvingAbility2021]. Coupled with a high reproductive rate, it may be able to numerically saturate this specific niche, effectively excluding more generalist species like *M. natalensis* that utilize both indoor and surrounding outdoor habitats. Furthermore, the invasion dynamics themselves may play a role. Dalecky *et al.* (2015) describe separate invasion fronts for *M. musculus* and *R. rattus*, suggesting that once one species establishes dominance in a locality via a particular human transport route, it may create a biotic barrier that resists invasion by the other. This would explain the mutually exclusive patterns observed in our study and others [@eskew_reservoir_2024].

Beyond the focal interactions involving invasive species, the analysis revealed broader community-level structures. The native rodent guild, including *P. rostratus*, *L. sikapusi*, and *M. setulosus*, showed strong positive correlations with one another, suggesting they form a cohesive community that likely shares microhabitat preferences not captured by our broad land use categories. In stark contrast, the presence of *M. musculus* in agricultural and village habitats was strongly and negatively correlated with this entire native guild. This pattern indicates that the establishment of the house mouse may lead not just to the displacement of a single competitor, but to a wholesale perturbation of the native rodent community. A different pattern of segregation was observed for the insectivorous shrew, *C. olivieri*, which was generally negatively correlated with most rodent species, likely reflecting niche partitioning between trophic guilds. We interpret this finding with caution, as our grain-based bait may have been less directly attractive to shrews; however, insects drawn to the bait could have indirectly attracted these insectivores, creating a complex detection scenario.


## Benefits and challenges of systematic small-mammal community sampling

Systematic investigation of small-mammal communities entails a greater sampling effort than targeted sampling of specific species in selected habitats. In this study, the overall TS was relatively low compared to other studies focusing on synanthropic rodent species [@olayemi_small_2018; @bangura_lassa_2021; @happi_increased_2022]. Our TS of 2.3% within villages aligns with the 3% reported in Bo, Sierra Leone, but is notably lower than the 17% and 14% reported in Nigeria and Guinea, respectively [@fichet-calvet_fluctuation_2007; @happi_increased_2022]. This discrepancy may arise from differences in trapping methodologies, including the size of traps, trap locations, or the behaviour of target species. For example, *M. natalensis* captures in its Western range were less frequent than those observed in Tanzania, where TS of around 24% were reported in agricultural settings [@mulungu_population_2013]. One potential explanation is that food availability in each setting might affect the species' behaviour, with environmental food sources influencing trap-shyness [@taylor_reactions_1974; @stryjek_unbiased_2019].

Despite the higher sampling effort required, systematic small-mammal community sampling offers distinct advantages over targeted species sampling. By adopting a broader, more inclusive approach, this method reduces the risk of overlooking less common species that may act as pathogen hosts and provides greater insight into biotic interactions between species. For instance, our sampling design allowed us to observe associations between synanthropic species like *M. musculus* and native species, offering a more holistic view of the ecological factors contributing to pathogen spread.

Comparison between studies using different sampling techniques presents several challenges. Previous studies on rodent communities in the Lassa fever endemic region have used TS as an indirect measure of rodent abundance [@fichet-calvet_diversity_2009; @olayemi_small_2018; @bangura_lassa_2021]. While we also present TS as a descriptive metric, we acknowledge that it can be a biased proxy for abundance. Our analysis, incorporating a model of imperfect detection, suggests estimating abundance from TS may not be applicable across different land use types and species (Supplementary Figure 8). For example, we observed that the probability of detecting *M. musculus* and *R. rattus* was higher than for native species when a consistent amount of trapping effort was applied. This finding aligns with previous research showing that detection rates may be unreliable proxies for relative abundance [@parsons_monitoring_2022]. Therefore, improving harmonisation of rodent sampling designs could enhance direct comparisons of species communities and pathogen prevalence across the Lassa fever endemic region [@simons_rodent_2023].

There are several limitations to the current study. One limitation is the relatively short duration of our animal sampling (less than three years). Given that rodent populations can fluctuate significantly over longer time periods, it is possible that important variations in abundance were missed. As a result, the probability of occurrence for certain species may have been underestimated, particularly for species that were at low abundance during our survey period. Extending the sampling period would help to better capture temporal changes in species occurrence and abundance. Furthermore, our trapping protocol, which involved closing traps during the day, likely under-represents diurnal or crepuscular species such as *L. striatus*, which could affect our estimates of community composition and diversity. Additionally, land use in Sierra Leone, particularly in agricultural areas, follows multi-year cycles of cultivation, fallow, and reconversion to cultivated land. To more comprehensively understand the effects of land use change on rodent communities, it would be useful to focus on a single location that spans the transition from forested land to agricultural, fallow, and degraded forest land use. Such a study would provide insights into how these different land management practices influence rodent community dynamics and pathogen risk. Finally, unobserved characteristics of the villages in our study may have contributed to variations in the composition of rodent communities, as suggested by the wide posterior distributions for some species. Expanding our study to include a greater number of villages would help increase the generalisability of our findings.

## Implications for understanding the risk of LASV spillover

The lower occurrence of *M. natalensis* in certain land uses is consistent with growing evidence of LASV prevalence heterogeneity across the endemic region [@marien_households_2020]. In some village communities, no current evidence of LASV transmission has been detected within rodent populations, despite prior human cases or serological evidence of outbreaks. This suggests that pathogen prevalence in rodents may vary significantly over time and space [@bangura_lassa_2021; @mccormick_prospective_1987; @leski_sequence_2015]. As discussed earlier, LASV transmission within a host community may be short-lived, with rapid local extinction of the virus [@goyens_density_2013]. These dynamics raise the possibility that non-*M. natalensis* species may play a crucial role in transferring the virus between communities of *M. natalensis* that are separated by unsuitable habitat, leading to pathogen re-introduction.

Current disease models of LASV risk largely fail to incorporate the role of multiple rodent species and the potential biotic interactions between them [@basinski_bridging_2021; @mylne_mapping_2015; @olugasa_rubber_2014; @redding_environmental-mechanistic_2016; @fichet-calvet_risk_2009; @klitting_predicting_2022]. Our findings, which highlight interactions between *M. natalensis* and primarily *M. musculus*, suggest that Lassa fever risk could potentially be reduced in areas where *M. musculus* is present. This raises the need for further research into the competence of *M. musculus* as a host for LASV, as previous serological evidence has shown exposure to the virus in this species [@demby_lassa_2001]. If *M. musculus* is not a competent host for LASV, this could help explain why Lassa fever is more commonly reported in rural areas of the endemic region, rather than urban centers, where *M. musculus* may have displaced more competent viral hosts.  To test this hypothesis, further research systematically sampling along the urban-rural gradient is essential. Such work could significantly impact future projections of Lassa fever risk, especially given the rapid population growth and urbanisation occurring across West Africa.
